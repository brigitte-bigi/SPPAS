    "description": "SPPAS can automatically create annotations from videos and/or recorded speech audio, as long as you give it the written words (orthographic transcription). It's also really helpful for analyzing and working with annotated data: estimating statistical distributions, making queries, managing files, editing annotations, and lots more. Plus, SPPAS has a file converter that can handle many different file types, like XRA, TextGrid, EAF, TRS, and others.",
